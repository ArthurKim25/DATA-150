## Abstract

This presentation seeks to explore the potential role of gender-disaggregated call detail records (CDR's) in studying vulnerability to climate change. In this day and age, we have phenomenal disaster forecasting abilities thanks to the GRACE and GRACE-Fo satellite programs as well as the use of machine learning and AI with our current climate models. However, in order for these forecasts to be useful, we have to know who is most vulnerable and make sure they receive appropriate warnings and aid. CDR's provide data about population dynamics a high spatial and temporal resolution, making them a great tool for knowing the population distribution and which people are located in the most vulnerable areas. By combining CDR's with our forecasting and tracking abilities, we have an amazing capacity to adapt to climate disasters, allowing us to improve the safety and well-being of our society.
However, up until recently, gender differences have barely been considered when addressing climate vulnerability. The fact of the matter is that men and women across many different cultures face distinct climate-related vulnerabilities that need to be addressed individually.  Unfortunately, progress in addressing gender disparities in climate vulnerability has been stifled by misconceptions and generalizations, which plague much of today's literature. Luckily, it has recently been shown that CDR's can be used to evaluate the dynamics of men and women separately. By using these gender-disaggregated CDR's for the purpose of assessing climate change vulnerability, we can observe the gender distribution among vulnerable groups of people. By knowing this, we can allocate aid specific to the gender proportions. Not only will this enhance the well-being of everybody, but will also help mitigate gender inequality in terms of suffering from climate disasters.
