## Abstract

This presentation seeks to explore the potential role of gender-disaggregated call detail records (CDR's) in studying vulnerability to climate change. In this day and age, we have phenomenal disaster forecasting abilities thanks to the GRACE and GRACE-Fo satellite programs as well as the use of machine learning and AI with our current climate models.
