##### Annotation:
The authors' main idea in this work is that geospatial data from mobile phones can be used to facilitate urban adaptation to the effects of climate change.  In addition, they emphasize the necessessity of government organizations to make better use of the data, knowledge and technology available for the purpose of addressing vulnerability to climate disasters and responding accordingly.  The main developmental problem the authors address is vulnerability and adaptive capabilities of urban communities to climate change disasters.  In addition, the authors address the need for better urban governance so that the limitations of mobile phone data can be properly addressed, and that knowledge accrued by other means can be integrated into the development of adaptive capabilities to climate change.
Complexity in regards to evaluating the risk of populations from climate disasters arises in that populations, natural disasters, and changes in land use are dynamic and highly unpredictable in the long-run.  As a result, evaluating vulnerability to climate disasters requires a high-degree of spatial and temporal accuracy, which is not possible by traditional censes.  The authors tackle this complexity by describing how the collection of mobile phone data offers a more continuous picture of population movement, allowing for government agencies to determine in real-time who is at the most risk.
