##### Annotation:
The authors' main idea in this work is that geospatial data from mobile phones can be used to facilitate urban adaptation to the effects of climate change.  In addition, they emphasize the necessessity of government organizations to make better use of the data, knowledge and technology available for the purpose of addressing vulnerability to climate disasters and responding accordingly.  The main developmental problem the authors address is vulnerability and adaptive capabilities of urban communities to climate change disasters.  In addition, the authors address the need for better urban governance so that the limitations of mobile phone data can be properly addressed, and that knowledge accrued by other means can be integrated into the development of adaptive capabilities to climate change.  Complexity in regards to evaluating the risk of populations from climate disasters arises in that populations, natural disasters, and changes in land use are dynamic and highly unpredictable in the long-run.  As a result, evaluating vulnerability to climate disasters requires a high-degree of spatial and temporal accuracy, which is not possible by traditional censes.  The authors tackle this complexity by describing how the collection of mobile phone data offers a more continuous picture of population movement, allowing for government agencies to determine in real-time who is at the most risk.

Through its focus on the decrease of vulnerability and risk of urban populations to climate change and the integration of different types of knowledge, this article connects to Amartya Sen's definition of human development.  If a population is susceptible to the ramifications of climate change, then the people are less able to live in security, which shows that the vulnerability discussed in this article can be viewed as Sen's idea of an unfreedom.  Additionally, the authors' discussion of the importance of urban governments incorporating different types of knowledge to allow for adaptive capabilities quintessentially exemplifies Sen's idea that freedoms themselves play a role in driving human development.  

The article particularly focuses on the population safety facet of human development, as it is about assessing vulnerability to climate change and adapting in order to improve preparation and response to resulting natural disasters. A sustainable developmental goal that can be considered is establishing a network of free-flowing information to urban government organizations from not only big data, but also from scientific experts. For one, this will help account for the limitations of using mobile phone data. Also this will bolster the adaptive capabilities of urban centers to climate change, improving population resilence and reducing risk.  

The geospatial datasets explored by the authors are Call Detail Records (CDR's). They explain that CDR's are obtained by localizing a caller to a Base Transceiver Station, and that movement of an individual can be determined through the activity through different antennas.  CDR's are useful for real-time measurements of population densities and human activity across different areas, allowing for accurate determinations of who is vulnerable to climate disasters.  In order to show the robustness of using CDR's to make estimations about populations, the authors discuss a study by Csáji et al. titled "Exploring the Mobility of Mobile Phone Uers" which showed that the estimations from CDR's had a correlation of 0.92 with those made from census data.
