The COVID-19 pandemic has heavily impacted a number of disciplines across both the sciences and humanities. Although the article doesn't describe exactly how COVID directly impacts chemistry, my prospective major, it does discuss its impacts on other fields stemming from chemistry such as biology and medicine. Because chemistry is one of the fundamental sciences, concerned with the laws of the universe rather than constantly monitoring complex adaptive systems, it is understandable that COVID doesn't have as nearly a significant impact on it. However, because COVID is biological in nature, its impact on biology, biochemistry and medicine has been substantial.
