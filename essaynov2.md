## Human Development Index Essay

For the Human Development Index Calculation, the United Nations accounts for the health, education and income of countries, as these are considered to be the main facets of human development.  For the 2020 calculation in particular, the UN accounted for child life expectancy, the amount of time kids stayed in school, and the living standards. Despite these being important aspects of human development, they do not form the best nor most complete measure for human development by themselves.  

Additional data that should be incorporated into the HDI measure is gender inequality. Although the UN did account for this in 1995, because gender inequality is a major issue and determinant of human development, it should be one of the annual facets examined by the HDI. Even across many different cultures, men and women overall have different livelihoods and do not coexist as a homogeneous group, so gender-disaggregated measurements are necessary in order to get a fuller picture of the developmental circumstances in countries. Additionally, gender equality is an important factor in human well-being.  By being able to live up to their full potential without the restrictions of gender expectations, people can attain much greater livelihoods, which according to Amartya Sen is paramount when considering human development. Discounting the importance of gender inequality results in ignorance to a large swath of problems that countries face, so it is necessary for it to be regularly considered in order to have a better HDI. Althuogh some people Tyler Cowen may argue that measuring GDP is sufficient when determining gender inequality of because of the correlation between the two.  However, as correlation does not equal causation, measuring just one factor does not tell the full story, so it is still best to measure gender inequality separately

In addition to gender inequality, another factor that should be regularly considered in the HDI is the level of democracy and freedom of speech. In his book, *Development as Freedom,* Sen emphasizes the importance of various freedoms, including democracy, when considering human development.
