The _Wall Street Journal_ article, "Hidden Debt Plagues Chinaâ€™s Belt and Road Infrastructure Plan, Studies Find" describes a Chinese endeavor to fund transportation infrastructure across many developing nations. Even though this project seems mutually beneficial, in that poor countries have more infrastructure while China gains more natural resources in return, there are many shortcomings resulting from the project. Because of the ramifications that will be incurred in the long run, I think that this project is in need of numerous changes.

Despite the purported economic growth from this project, China persists in maintaining high-interest loans with the developing countries in which they operate. This has lead to debt traps, with many developing countries owing more than their GDP. This exacerbates rather than mitigates poverty within these countries, making the project counterproductive.
