## Climate Change Vulnerability: Using Gender-Disaggregated CDR's to Mitigate Gender Disparity
#### Summary
We propose an investigation utilizing gender-disaggregated call detail records (CDR's) in order to test their effectiveness in facilitating the mitigation of gender disparities in climate change vulnerability. 
#### Motivation and Reasoning for this Study
Climate change is a dire issue that affects the entire world and brings about many ramifications. In most places around the world, men and women do not suffer the same way from climate change due to a number of factors such as differences in lifestyles and stereotypic gender perceptions (6, 8). As a result, men and women have different specific needs when it comes to addressing their vulnerabilities (8). One of the biggest gaps in the literature is the lack of adequate gender-disaggregated data in climate studies (6). This makes it very easy to have to rely on assumptions and generalizations rather than facts, which results in inadequate climate policies and action (6). With our investigation, we will produce an objective, real-time measurement of the distributions of each gender in vulnerable areas, filling this gap. We anticipate that wherever we act, people of all genders will benefit from this because it will facilitate the enactment of more effective gender-focused climate policies, aid allocation, and proactive adaptive measures, overall reducing vulnerability.
