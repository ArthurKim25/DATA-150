It is no mystery that climate change is a dire issue that plagues all of humanity. Therefore, much research has gone into understanding how it affects populations and human development, as well as the ability to forecast climate-related disasters so that we can act accordingly. Today, we understand that not everybody is affected the same way from the effects of climate change, and as a result, different needs need to be met (7).  To put it simply, we know that climate change has negative effects on popolations across the globe, despite all of the regional differences (1, 3, 5-7). In order to determine and deal with vulnerability to different climate disasters, we have sophisticated means of forecasting as well as geospatial population data which allow for appropriate warnings and action. Despite our understanding and technical prowess, we have not perfected our ability to evaluate vulnerability and make policies accordingly. For one, due to the high amount of complexity in climate science, it is near-impossible to perfectly determine the effects of climate change (6). Additionally, only recently have we begun to understand the importance of considering the role of sex and gender in climate change vulnerability (7).  As a result, much of the current climate change literature fails to account for such.

Today, we have a vast understanding of the ramifications of climate change that different populations suffer.  Todd Pugatch in his *World Development* article, "Tropical Storms and Mortality Under Climate Change" addresses how climate change disasters adversely affect human health.  With a case study in Mexico using storm windspeed data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Tropical Prediction Center and mortality data from Mexican Vital Statistics records, Pugatch found that hurricanes and tropical storms as a result of climate change result in an increased mortality rate. In order to increase the security of populations in the face of climate disasters, it is necessary to be prepared and evacuate if necessary. Pugatch also discusses how impoverished communities see higher mortality when struck by severe storms due to their lack of robust infrastructure, as well as that a higher amount of economic development helps mitigate the mortality from tropical storms (6). This connects to Amartya Sen's idea of how socioeconomic freedoms (or lack thereof) act in a positive feedback mechanism.

We know that climate change disasters, especially in developing areas, result in reduced economic and food security. Carlo Azzarri and Sara Signorelli in their *World Development* article, "Climate and Poverty in Africa South of the Sahara" examine the ramifications of climate shocks on Sub-Saharan African (SSA) population welfare. In their study, they used household surveys from 24 different SSA countries, which provide information of household consumption expenditure and income per capita at the sub-national level. This allowed for them to account for heterogeneity within the countries, making the data more robust. In order to determine droughts, heatwaves and floods, they use data from the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), which contains data on precipitation, temperature and evapotranspiration. By regressing these data, they found that there is in fact a correlation between population welfare and the ramifications of climate change.
