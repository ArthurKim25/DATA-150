## Gender Disaggregated CDR's and Climate Change: Data Science Methods

Because climate change is a dire issue affecting all of humanity, much research has gone into understanding how it affects populations and human development, as well as forecasting climate-related disasters so that we can act accordingly. In order to determine and deal with people’s numerous vulnerabilities to climate disasters, we have developed sophisticated means of forecasting and using geospatial population data in order to allow for appropriate warnings and action.  For one, we use call detail records (CDR’s) in order to generate a spatially-accurate map of population dynamics.  Additionally, in order to accurately forecast disasters such as floods and droughts, we have combined AI with Earth System Model (ESM) data, as well as used satellites (GRACE) to directly measure changes in mass distributions.   Despite our understanding and technical prowess, we have not perfected our ability to evaluate vulnerability and make policies accordingly. For one, due to the high amount of complexity in climate science, it is near-impossible to perfectly determine the effects of climate change (7). Additionally, only recently have we begun to understand the importance of considering the role of sex and gender in climate change vulnerability (8).  Luckily however, a recent study has shown that gender-disaggregated CDR’s are a feasible data-gathering method.  Therefore, they can be used to evaluate the gender distributions within the most vulnerable groups, giving us a better idea of the needs that will need to be fulfilled. By ensuring that people receive the specific aid that they need, we can help reduce inequality in terms of vulnerability co climate change, promoting greater gender equality in our society.

CDR's have proven to be an effective means of evaluating population dynamics. When a cell-phone user makes a phone call, they are localized to a Base Transciever Station (BTS). CDR's include information on the BTS location of a caller, the time and duration of the call, and of importance for this study, the gender of the caller. Using Voronoi Tesselations, the approximate coverage areas of each BTS antenna can be mapped. When callers are localized to different BTS's over time, we have a highly accurate picture of their dynamics because of the relatively small areas of the tesselated segments. Because of the spatial and temporal elements of CDR's, when the CDR's of many callers are aggregated, they provide an accurate map of population dynamics and offer insight about human activities.
