## Gender Disaggregated CDR's and Climate Change: Data Science Methods
###### Word Count:

Because climate change is a dire issue affecting all of humanity, much research has gone into understanding how it affects populations and human development, as well as forecasting climate-related disasters so that we can act accordingly. In order to determine and deal with people’s numerous vulnerabilities to climate disasters, we have developed sophisticated means of forecasting and using geospatial population data in order to allow for appropriate warnings and action.  For one, we use call detail records (CDR’s) in order to generate a spatially-accurate map of population dynamics (2).  Additionally, in order to accurately forecast disasters such as floods and droughts, we have combined AI with Earth System Model (ESM) data (4), as well as used satellites (GRACE) to directly measure changes in mass distributions (7). Despite our understanding and technical prowess, we have not perfected our ability to evaluate vulnerability and make policies accordingly. For one, due to the high amount of complexity in climate science, it is near-impossible to perfectly determine the effects of climate change (5). Additionally, only recently have we begun to understand the importance of considering the role of sex and gender in climate change vulnerability (6).  Luckily however, a recent study has shown that gender-disaggregated CDR’s are a feasible data-gathering method.  Therefore, they can be used to evaluate the gender distributions within the most vulnerable groups, giving us a better idea of the needs that will need to be fulfilled. By ensuring that people receive the specific aid that they need, we can help reduce inequality in terms of vulnerability co climate change, promoting greater gender equality in our society.

CDR's have proven to be an effective means of evaluating population dynamics. When a cell-phone user makes a phone call, they are localized to a Base Transciever Station (BTS) (2). CDR's include information on the BTS location of a caller, the time and duration of the call, and of importance for this study, the gender of the caller (3). When callers are localized to different BTS's over time, we have a highly accurate picture of their dynamics because of the relatively small areas of the antenna coverage areas (Figure 1) (2). Because of the spatial and temporal elements of CDR's, when the CDR's of many callers are aggregated, they provide an accurate map of population dynamics and offer insight about human activities (2). Rahul Goel et al. in their *Plos One* article, "Understanding gender segregation through Call Data Records: An Estonian case study" disaggregated the CDR's by gender in order to measure the dynamics of men and women separately (3). This can be applied in the study of climate change vulnerability in order to reduce disproportionality by gender. By knowing who is located in areas forecasted to be hit hard by climate disasters, appropriate warnings can be issued in order to bolster adaptive capacities and minimize harm. Ultimately, CDR's are considered secondary data because the data are generated by the cell companies only to be used later by researchers.

###### Figure 1: Based on the call patterns of individuals over time and the BTS's they are localized to, we can get a rough sense of their trajectory (2). Figure A also showcases a Voronoi Tesselation, used in order to localize all points in space to the nearest cellular antenna.

Like in most disciplines in the modern world, ML and AI have found their way into climate science and disaster forecasting. The ML finds correlations in big ESM data, which allow for forecasts of disasters to be made. Using this information, AI can issue timely automated warnings, improving societal adaptive capacities (4). The ESM data iself is the aggregation of meterological data, specifically the relationships between climate and geological cycles, which can be used to generate predictive outputs of the climate (4). The outputs of numerous different ESM's have been aggregated into a single database called Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5), which has been invaluable for modeling the complex climate (4). Unfortunately however, CMIP5 has had issues due to discrepancies between the different ESM's. ML and AI thanks to their analytical prowess have helped mend this issue (4).

Recent notable sources of ESM data have been the GRACE and GRACE Follow-on (GRACE-Fo) satellite programs (7). The original GRACE program lasted from 2002 to 2017; thanks to its success, the second GRACE-Fo satellites were launched which are currently in operation (7). The objective of GRACE is to directly measure changes in the hydrological mass distribution (7). In order to do so, GRACE consists of two satellites orbiting in tandem with a constant distance between them (7). Large variations in the terrestrial mass distribution caused by large water sources like glaciers, terrestrial bodies of water, and large reservoirs cause slight perturbations in the Earth's gravity field (7). When the GRACE satellites travel through the warped gravitational field, the distance between them changes slightly (7). The distance can be precisely determined and by using physics calculations, the mass distribution can be quantified (7). Changes in the hydrological mass distribution can be determined when the GRACE satellites fly over the same area multiple times and experience different perturbations in the distance between them (7). These changes in the mass distribution directly influence the climate, and can therefore be used to forecast disasters well in advance (7).  

In order for CDR's to be useful for mapping the movement of people, it is necessary that each point on the surface of the Earth be associated with a specific antenna. Csáji et al. in their *Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications* article, "Exploring the Mobility of Mobile Phone Users" accomplished this using a Voronoi Tesselation (Figure 1A), which divides space into specific areas based on the closest antenna to each point in space (1). The adjacent areas around the most frequently used antennae were grouped together using Delaunay Neighborship in order to designate "locations" of interest (1). In order to work out overall calling patterns, k-means clustering was used with k=3, which revealed a clear spatio-temporal pattern of caller activity and dynamics (1). This pattern nicely followed the independent statistics from the Portuguese National Institute of Statistics (INE) (Figure 2), validating the use of CDR's as a means of assessing the overall population dynamics (1).

###### Figure 2: The pattern of call dynamics worked out using k-means clustering with k=3 (1). Figure b shows that they fall nicely with INE data, validating them (1).

The main technique the ESM ML and AI focused on was dimension reduction, which is a technique in linear algebra that squishes information down into a lower-dimensional subspace of the original dataset at the cost of losing some of the data (4). This technique can be applied to differential equations, which are the primary means of mathematically modeling the climate (4). By focusing on a smaller subset of the data, it's much easier to find connections between the variables, improving the models and reducing uncertainty (4). By combining AI and ML with the technique of dimension reduction, it is much easier to pick out relationships and make new discoveries, as well as mitigate uncertainty (4). 

As stated previously, by measuring changes in the distance between the satellites, the GRACE programs can detect perturbations in the Earth's gravitational field from variations in the mass distribution (7). This gives a precise measurement of the hydrological mass distribution, allowing us to make accurate predictions about future climate disasters (7). Specifically, because the satellites orbit side-by-side, whenever they approach a perturbation in the gravitational field, they will experience acceleration at slightly different times (Figure 3) (7). This will cause the distance between the satellites as well as their velocities to change proportionally based on the gravitational potential caused by the mass (7). The change in the distance is precisely determined with a dual-frequency K-band inter-satellite ranging system (7). Variations in the distance resulting from non-gravitational causes are accounted for using an accelerometer (7). When the GRACE satellites travel over the same area multiple times, the rate of mass change can be determined (7). For example, the authors describe GRACE's measurements of ice melting in Greenland. It was found that over time, the mass of Greenlandian ice decreased which in turn caused the sea level to rise (7).

###### Figure 3: This graphic shows how anomalies in the mass distribution result in velocity differences, causing the distance between the satellites to change depending on how much mass there is. (7)

When Csáji et al. regressed their CDR-based estimations of the positions of frequent locations with independent data from the INE, the correlation was 0.92 (1). This means that the CDR-based measurements very closely followed those generated from independent statistics, validating CDR's as a spatio-temporal measurement of overall population dynamics. Therefore, it follows that using gender-disaggregated CDR's are an accurate measure of the overall dynamics of the different genders as well as gender distributions, allowing for their use in vulnerability assessments.  Going back to the example of ice mass, the authors mention how GRACE calculated the average rate of mass loss in Greenland to be -258 ± 26 gigatons per year during the years of its operation, with 26 representing two standard deviations (Figure 4) (7). The measurements of Antarctica show much greater uncertainty (Figure 4), however there is clearly still a trend of ice mass decreasing over time. Because we have the ability to measure changes in the mass distribution with decent precision, AI and ML can draw much more clear connections and make better predictions, improving our forecasts. With our improved forecasts, we can more readily know the areas that will suffer the most and use CDR's in order to know who to warn.

###### Figure 4: Measurements recorded by GRACE show that the ice mass in Greenland and Antarctica have decreased over time, which directly relates to sea levels rising. (7)

Although gender-disaggregated CDR's have been used in studying segregation, they could also be used for examining possible gender disparities in vulnerability assessments. Unfortunately, Dujardin et al. failed to disaggregate the CDR's by gender, so they provided no insight into how the overall dynamics of different genders can contribute to disproportionate vulnerability. However, by evaluating the gender dynamics and gender distributions in vulnerable areas, we can more effectively prevent unequal suffering and allocate appropriate aid, improving the well-being of all genders. According to Amartya Sen, ensuring well-being is an essential component of human progress and development.
