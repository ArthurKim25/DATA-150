### Answer to Question 1
The toaster project was an endeavor by Thomas Thwaites to build a functioning toaster from scratch, using only raw materials.  Thwaites reverse-engineered a cheap, functional toaster in order to determine the parts and materials he would need, and then procured the raw materials in order to fabricate the parts of a toaster.  When he was finished, his toaster turned on but burst into flames because of a lack of insulation, so Thwaites called his project a "partial success."  The toaster project relates to the idea of complexity and development in that it showed that there are a wide variety of necessary resources and technology required for even seemingly simple phenomenon, analogous to how there are many different facets (i.e. economic, financial, legal, social, political) that play a role in shaping human development.

### Answer to Question 2
Over the past 50 years, economic models have done poorly at describing and predicting growth since they all failed to account for additional factors. Barder first discusses the Harrod-Domar model which was based on the idea that an increase in production requires more capital and labor.  He then discusses how it failed to explain the disparity in growth paradigms between Ghana and South Korea, in that South Korea saw massive economic growth while Ghana was mostly stagnant.  In addition, Barder discusses the Ajoakuta Steel works and how it had immense labor and capital from investment, but it was a failure because of corruption and poor management, showing how it failed to account for the ramifications of institutional problems. 

### Answer to Question 3
Steve Jones was a biologist who worked at uni-lever to design a better soap nozzle.  He was very successful, as his ultimate design was hundreds of times more efficient than the original nozzle.  In order to make an evolutionary jump forward, Jones made several copies of the nozzle, then randomly distorted each of them, and determined which distortions produced the best results.  He then repeated the process using the best-performing nozzle from the previous generation.  He did so for 45 generations in order to produce his final design.  His results were significant because they showed the power of evolutionary growth in generating groundbreaking solutions, as his process led to the design of a nozzle that was hundreds of times more efficient.
