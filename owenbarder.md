### Answer to Question 1
The toaster project was an endeavor by Thomas Thwaites to build a functioning toaster from scratch, using only raw materials.  Thwaites reverse-engineered a cheap, functional toaster in order to determine the parts and materials he would need, and then procured the raw materials in order to fabricate the parts of a toaster.  When he was finished, his toaster turned on but burst into flames because of a lack of insulation, so Thwaites called his project a "partial success."  The toaster project relates to the idea of complexity and development in that it showed that there are a wide variety of necessary resources and technology required for even seemingly simple phenomenon, analogous to how there are many different facets (i.e. economic, financial, legal, social, political) that play a role in shaping human development.
