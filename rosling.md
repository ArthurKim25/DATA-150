### Response to question 1

Rosling found that the students scored an average of 1.8 questions correctly out of 5, which is worse than how the average chimpanzee would score by randomly selecting answers. In addition, Rosling found that the Swedish Professors scored an average of 2.4 correctly, which is on par with the chimpanzees. This result is significant in that it shows that there is a great misunderstanding about the socioeconomical situations in different parts of the world.

### Response to question 2

Preceding economic growth in Asia, Rosling mentions that there was a massive growth in the overall health of the population. He notes the trend of an increase in life expectancy and a decrease in family size from 1964 to the present in Vietnam. In addition, when comparing the rates of development in Brazil and South Korea, he points out how the South Korean population was healthier and therefore developed faster than Brazil. Overall, he shows that development of health is an important foundation for the development of a better economy.

### Response to question 3

In accordance with Rosling's TED talk, there is a strong postive linear releationship between Child Survival and GDP per Capita.  This further supports his idea that the health of a population is essential before the economy can thrive.  

### Response to question 4

Rosling shows that from 1962 to 2003, the global income distribution becomes less right-skewed than before. A Rosling previously explained a trend of global health generally improving, it makes sense that there is also an increase in wealth in accordance with the trend of better health resulting in better economic development.
